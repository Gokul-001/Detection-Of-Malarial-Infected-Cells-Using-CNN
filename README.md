<h4> <li>Malaria is a fatal illness which is solely transmitted
through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. 
According to the recent studies, which shows that in the year 
2020 there were 241 million cases of malaria worldwide which 
results in the death of nearly 6,27,000 people. It is crucial that the 
diagnostic process be automated in order to avoid human 
participation during the automated diagnosis because the 
majority of these deaths are caused by a delayed or inaccurate 
diagnosis. </li>

<li>In order to enhance the diagnostic reliability
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other deep-learning 
technologies, such as image processing, are employed to assess
parasitemia in microscopic blood slides.</li>
<li>We highlight some of 
our recent significant innovations on highly accurate 
classification of malaria-infected cells using deep supervised 
learning in deep convolutional neural networks. The first task is 
to outline the methodologies for image processing that can be 
applied to the dataset which is going to be utilized to train the 
model.</li>
<li>Then we will discuss the procedures of for training of 
deep neural network, as well as data augmentation methods used 
to significantly increase the size of the dataset and to improve the 
performance of our developed model. </li>
<li>Lastly, using the same 
datasets for both training and testing, we will compare the 
classification accuracy outcomes from deep convolutional neural 
networks. With the provided blood smear samples, this trained 
model will be utilized to forecast the presence of malaria-infected 
cells.</h4></li>
<h4> <li>The deep learning model which we developed gives an 
accuracy of 97%</h4></li>
